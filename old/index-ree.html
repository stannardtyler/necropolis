        The Santa Clara Mission Cemetery has many stories and historical
        significance that has been hidden over time to those that live in the
        valley. This cemetery was the first Christian cemetery in the Santa
        Clara Valley and was founded by the same
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciscans"
          >Franciscan Padres</a
        >
        who founded
        <a href="https://www.scu.edu/missionchurch/"
          >Mission Santa Clara de Asis</a
        >
        in 1777.

        <br />
        <br />
        To walk through the older areas of the cemetery is to travel through
        nearly 165 years of history. At Santa Clara Mission Cemetery there
        repose many early Santa Clara Valley pioneers; Spaniards, Mexican,
        Americans, and others of rich and varied ethnic backgrounds. Included
        are Pedro de Saisset (French Vice-Consul, businessman and
        philanthropist),Triburcio Vasquez (known as the "Robin Hood Bandit"),
        Antonio Maria Pico (three times Alcalde of San Jose), Myles Poore
        O'Connor (lawyer, judge and philanthropist) and Peter Burnett (the first
        Governor of California).
        <br />
        <br />
        More historical information can be found at the
        <a
          href="https://santaclaramissioncemetery.org/about-us#:~:text=history,Clara%20changed%20locations%204%20times."
          >SCMC website.

      <p>
        Over time, the cemetery has experience vandalism and acciendental damage
        from visitors over time, where gravestones and memorials alike have been
        experienced damage which goes on without repair. As the COVID pandmic
        has reduced the impact of visitation the location has experienced a
        break from activity, however this may in turn create a shroud of mystery
        and continue to hide the important histories of this locale which will
        be further forgotten in time to the surrounding populus. With the
        intentions of archiving and education, this project hopes to present
        virtual reditions of these historical sites and memorials in this
        cemetery online to allow open virtual access and to experience the early
        histories of the Santa Clara Valley.
