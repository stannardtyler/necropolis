      For the Second take at the Santa Clara Mission project, my goal is to take the 3D experience further by incorporating a fully interactive 3D space to push further than the standard 3D model viewer. Inspired by the "emulation" concept, I hope to immerse users fully into this simulated experience.
      <br>
      <br>
      For these goal, I will explore both <a href="https://www.babylonjs.com/" target="_blank">Babylon.js</a> and <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank">Three.js</a> to craft either a higher detailed 3D model viewer (with Babylon) or a fully navigatable 3D webgl environment (three.js). Below are links to the various attempts at 'hacking' the examples from both sights. For now I am to get dynamic results in Three.js examples.

        <li>"Pointclicker" original example. <a href="https://threejs.org/examples/?q=contr#misc_controls_pointerlock">Source</a></li>
    </ul>

     <ul>
        <li>Babylon 3D viewer in webpage with no style edits. <a href="test.html">Tutorial Example</a></li>
        <li>Babylon full 3D viewer. <a href="testglb.html">Link</a></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Babylon examples were a bit different to navigate and successfully "hack", so instead read through the docs to get custom models loaded. Three.js was a handful to get set up, but I think I'm making better progress at that front. Will continue to prototype during the week.

    The examples are a bit ruff, but so was the code LOL.
